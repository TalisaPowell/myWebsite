			<p><strong>AI and Cyber Security</strong></p>
			<P>Throughout the history of the human race, technological advancements have become inevitable. Ever since stone tools were introduced, humans have strived for better and faster technology. Moore's Law states that about every two years the speed and capabilities of computers doubles. This brings technological advancements to present day with artificial intelligence (AI) and cybersecurity. </p>
			<p>The ever-so-rapid growth of computer science has brought upon a fourth industrial revolution. The modern world depends on technology more today than it ever has before, however; these technologies can come with risks. For example, cybercrime can occur, in which an individual or organization attempts or succeeds in stealing, altering, or destroying information from another individual ("What Is a Cyber Attack?"). Some cybercrimes include, but are not limited to, "malware, ransomware, phishing, denial of service (DoS), SQL injection, and backdoor trojan" (Sarker). For background, malware can destroy data of the infected system, ransomware is when hackers tightly encrypt data to take it hostage in trade for ransoms, and phishing is an attempt to steal passwords or credentials through sending emails or texts. Crimes such as these can lead to disruptions or financial losses. Ransoms can be demanded of the hacker, in which billions of dollars are lost due to these attacks annually. Trying to retrieve this data and prevent attacks can be timely, which is why AI can aid cybersecurity so well.</p>
			<p>Artificial intelligence is a field of computer science that focuses on the creation of intelligent machines that can think like humans. There are several techniques involved with AI: machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, knowledge representation and reasoning, and rule-based expert systems (Sarker). Machine learning can be used to train the AI to detect malware or different types of cyberattacks. Deep learning is similar to machine learning except that it is more accurate seeing as it can collect more information on potential attacks. As the AI learns through past attacks, it can determine whether or not a new attack is going to occur based off of deviations from the established norms ("Using Artificial Intelligence in Cybersecurity"). These norms can include the system's power usage, data transfer speed and volume, along with other factors.</p>
			<p>While there are several techniques to develop AI, there are also three types of AI that are relevant today. Assisted intelligence is a type that is used in conjunction with a human's activities. This allows humans' actions to be more efficient and do not rely mostly on the machine's "intelligence". Augmented intelligence is the second type, it is planned to be widely used but is still being developed. This is the type that allows cybersecurity to defend against other AI threats by training the system with data to replicate a human's thought process on a grander scale. The third type is autonomous intelligence, which is currently being introduced. This type includes AI that can act without user input. An example of this type would be a self-driving car, once the automated mode is turned on the machine can drive completely without human input ("Using Artificial Intelligence in Cybersecurity"). The type of intelligence used depends on the implementation scenario, as AI is meant to assist human performance.</p>
			<p>With the rapid expansion of enterprises, AI's capability of handling enormous amounts of data is essential when dealing with cybersecurity. With machine learning techniques, AI performs at a much faster rate than humans can and is able to detect multiple varieties of different cyberattacks and can flag suspicious behavior that may lead to another cyberattack (Belani). These suspicious activities can include a log-in from another country, a background process taking up memory, or even something more obvious such as a process that duplicates itself. While these activities seem obvious on one machine and easy to defend, especially with an added artificial intelligence, dealing with a corporation that has "10s or 100s of thousands of devices, hundreds of attack vectors, and overall, a vast attack surface" can be nearly impossible without highly trained AI ("Using Artificial Intelligence in Cybersecurity").</p>
			<p>Although AI seems to be the solution to our ever-growing needs, there are some drawbacks. The same techniques used to keep cyberattacks out can also be used to commit cybercrimes. Hackers can use "target selection or attack timing to avoid detection" if need be, including AI password guessing (Durbin). This password guessing method is known as a brute-force attack and is the most common type of attack. A regular brute-force attack includes guessing commonly used passwords along with combinations of letters, numbers, and special symbols. With artificial intelligence, the attack can be improved to implement personal data. This may include understanding who the attack is on and having possible passwords include a birthday or special name/date. While this is a lot for a human to process, AI can easily handle the factors and can better randomize possible passwords based on training data and the search algorithm.</p>
			<p>As MIT Technology Review Insights, in association with Darktrace, states in a survey of 309 business executives, "74% of survey respondents worry about email and phishing attacks." While these attacks typically do not integrate artificial intelligence, attacks that do are "almost indistinguishable from genuine communications from trusted contacts" ("Preparing for AI-Enabled Cyberattacks"). In the survey, the respondents were also questioned about how weary they feel about different methods of attack using AI. 57% of the respondents were worried about a more effective form of ransomware. With an evolved form of cyberattacks, the only way to combat them is to keep up with the training of the AI that defends from it. 60% of the respondents reported that "human-driven responses to cyberattacks are failing to keep up with automated attacks" and 96% report that "they have already begun to guard against AI-powered attacks, some enabling AI defenses."</p>
			<p>In conclusion, AI can help discover potential risks, direct incident response, and identify malware attacks before they happen, but also can lead to advanced cyberattacks that can only be defended from with a highly trained AI. If the defending artificial intelligence cannot keep up, attackers will cost companies billions annually in ransomware attacks and other destructive attacks (Sarker).</p><br>
